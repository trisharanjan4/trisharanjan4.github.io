Hello! Hope you’re having a good day because after you reach the end of this post, I would ask you to help me in fulfilling what might be a dream to some.

I was 10 when my brother left the city for higher studies leaving me no one to play with at home. I have always been one of those girls who enjoyed playing cricket and football in the sun than playing with dolls inside the house. I’m not quite sure whether my parents understood this or not, because they never allowed me to play cricket with the boys in my colony. When my girlfriends would come over to my house to play, we never chose the same game and gradually I saw myself playing cricket all by myself because that’s what I enjoyed the most. I would bowl and aim for the wicket at the other end, and that’s how I learned.

When I was 13, I got selected from my school to represent my district in women’s cricket. But, my school did not allow me to miss classes for that and hence I couldn’t attend the camp. I remember one guy from the cricket association consoled my father saying that there is no scope for women’s cricket in this country anyway. But I was still happy, because my Dad saw me play for the first time and like any Indian father, secretly appreciated my game to my mother.

When I was 14, I started playing basketball because that was the only sport my all-girls school seriously supported. I loved the game. The energy, the speed, the feeling of scoring a basket or just the joy of playing with friends. We were always in the hit-list of teachers because scoring good marks would give us a better life and not scoring baskets, they claimed. I even remember being scolded for falling down and hurting myself because that apparently, took away my concentration from studies. But these were the same teachers who swelled up with pride when our school won the championships.

I was 15, when I got selected to play basketball at higher levels but couldn’t attend a single camp because studies are important and girls do not look nice when they play sports after growing up. I was one the finest players in my school at time but duh, not like I scored a 100/100 in Math.

The point I am trying to make is, why pursuing sports as a career looked down upon in our country? After a sports person becomes famous or has made their country proud, the entire nation supports them, but you wouldn't find a single player who has achieved that glory without constant reminders of, ‘Playing won’t fetch you any success in life, concentrate on your studies.’

My Maths tution teacher used to say, >“Studying is the easiest way to earn money, everything else requires lot of struggle.” Our parents and teachers do not support sports as a career because they think it’s short lived and requires a lot of struggle. Also, there’s no job security. Maybe during their time they encountered the same old issues we face today, but all these reasons are nullified in today’s world because even the highest paid IT jobs these days are not secure and with engineers in every nook and corner of the world, let’s not even get started on struggle!

In India, we need the sports culture. It is the fundamental pillar for our country’s booming future. Unless there is a positive energy around it, we would still be the second most populated country and the second-last in the Olympic standings. With terrains so diverse, race and genetic characteristics is never a problem. When countries like Jamaica and Kenya can produce such good sportsmen where the per-capita income is so low, poverty is also ruled out as a reason.

Lionel Messi tried out for Barcelona at the age of 13 and got selected because the administration saw potential in him. The management plays a major role in nurturing the career of the deserved candidates. I can say this from my personal experience that the day the administration starts selecting the worthy contestants rather than fortifying their best interests, we will definitely bag more medals in all international platforms.

It is time now, to change the stereotypical mindset, to accept the choice of sports as career as willingly as Science or Law, to make efforts to educate people about  Olympics in villages and other tournaments where it is lesser known and, to be the administration that gives great players to the world and not the one that people regret getting involved into. Let’s do our bit, let’s make India proud.
